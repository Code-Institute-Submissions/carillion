# Carillion Guitars

The purpose of this project was to create a static web-page for a local guitar luthier, Carillion Guitars. 

Carillion Guitars make world-class custom built instruments for the heavy metal market. As the guitars are handbuilt solely by one luthier from scratch the lead-time is extensive but thusly has earned them a prolific reputation. 


## UX

The brand supplies custom made guitars for prestigious artists who tour globally and the web-page is to demonstrate what models are on offer and also the wide variety of finishes and designs that are available. 

Largely important to this site, over a typical guitar manufacturers site is the variations of one product and also the prestiege that comes with owning one of these guitars. 

Therefore I included;

- References to the artists that use these products - instantly visible upon viewing the homepage. 
- An easy reference to the different shapes/designs of guitars
- Video of artist using a unique design
- Gallery showing the quality of recent work by the company
- Social links so potential customers can keep up with latest posts



This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features

Homepage

Carousel -
The homepage carousel shows quickly the range of artists that are on the artist roster. These names should be instantly recognisable to anyone who has come to the site. 
(Carousel tagline/about - this supports the above carousel and gives a small supportive statement to affirm the quality of the brand)
Included in the images is a quoted review from each artist.  

Iframe Video;
The purpose of the video is to engage users and to encourage them to view the use of one of the guitars with a well known artist. 

Modals (news);
The last section of the homepage is modals that the user an click on to again support the tight affiliation of the company with the leading players in the target market. In future updates of this project I would probably either remove this section or link directly to a social media post.

Guitars

Image cards
I provided images to the types of guitars available at Carillion. Design-wise it was difficult to know what to implement here as there is no standard product to offer as each item is one-of-a-kind and this would be covered in the gallery. In future I would implement a 'cost estimator' style template where the user could pick from different options and it would generate an estimated cost. 

Gallery

Fancybox 
I used fancybox here to implement my gallery which allows the user to see thumbnails, click the item to view larger image and also start a slideshow.

Nav's and Footers
All pages have the same navbar fixed to the top of the screen and a footer with links to the social media of the company.

- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Once I become more proficient with new languages and methods there is a lot I would like to do with this project. 

I would like to add a cost-calculator, sound clips of the guitars, a more extensive video section that demonstrates the guitars. 

## Technologies Used

[HTML5]
    Used to build the front end of the website
[CSS] 
    Used to style the website

[Bootstrap 3]
 - (https://bootstrapcdn.com)
    - Used to for the navbars, footers and sections of layouts such as cards and displays of modals

[JQuery]
(https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


[Javascript]
(https://javascript.com)
    - Used to add some animation to opening of modals. Used with Fancybox. 

[Fancybox]
(https://fancybox.net)
    - Used to add gallery and slideshow


## Testing

1. navbar
    1. Test all links on each page

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
